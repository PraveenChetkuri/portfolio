                <h2>Cricket</h2>
                <p>My cricket journey began at a tender age, marking the start of a lifelong passion. Representing my school team, I played in numerous division-level tournaments, demonstrating skill and dedication on the field. By the 9th standard, I proudly took on the role of captain, leading my team with determination and strategy.</p>

                <p> Continuing my cricket endeavors into my bachelor's studies in Information Technology, I captained our branch team for three years. Under my leadership, we clinched the tournament title twice in four years, a testament to our teamwork and perseverance.</p>
                    
                    <p>Today, my connection with cricket remains unwavering. I cherish playing cricket on weekends, reliving the thrill of the game and the joy it brings. Watching cricket is equally exhilarating, especially when my favorite cricketer, Virat Kohli, is on the field, inspiring me with his exemplary performance and undying spirit.</p>
